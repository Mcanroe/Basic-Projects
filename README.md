There seems to be an issue with loading Jupyter notebooks occasionally. Please try the following if you face an issue : 

1. Open "https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/"
2. Paste the link to the notebook, (e.g. "https://github.com/iurisegtovich/PyTherm-applied-thermodynamics/blob/master/index.ipynb") there and then you get "http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/iurisegtovich/PyTherm-applied-thermodynamics/blob/master/index.ipynb"
