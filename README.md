There seems to be an issue with loading Jupyter notebooks occasionally. Please try the following if you face an issue : 

1. Open "https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/"
2. Paste the link to the notebook, (e.g. "https://github.com/Mcanroe/Basic-Projects/blob/master/Analysing%20Free%20Profitable%20iOS%20and%20Android%20Apps/App%20Stores%20Analysis.ipynb") there and then you get "https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Mcanroe/Basic-Projects/blob/master/Analysing%20Free%20Profitable%20iOS%20and%20Android%20Apps/App%20Stores%20Analysis.ipynb"
